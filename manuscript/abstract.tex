Alan Turing had created a universal algorithm that can simulate all other algorithms. 
John von Neumann had constructed an automata that can reconstruct itself. 
In this paper we give a learning Turing machine that can learn any halting Turing machines. 
The main goal is to create a definition for machine learning that will be able to capture the non-increasing property of entropy of living systems described by Erwin Schr√∂dinger.
