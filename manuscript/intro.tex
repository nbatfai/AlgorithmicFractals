\caption{This figure shows the architecture of a universal learning machine. The operation of the machine $S$ is based on the Lemma 3.2.1 of \cite{TheorRobopsy}. $R$ uses $configN$ configurations that is denoted by the parameter $N$ in the sequence of configurations ${\langle c^N_i\rangle}_T^x$. If a transition rule is not uniquely determined then $S$ halts and $R$ restarts the simulation of $T$ by using a larger size of configuration.\label{fig_ULM}}
